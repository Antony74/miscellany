Tools such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) will allow you to capture your screen as a video.

Tools such as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) will allow you to convert this video to an animated gif.

This doesn't look great because the color palette on a gif is quite limited, but some very fiddly command line options will allow you to make better use  of it.

Hence the batch file. (taken from an [answer](http://superuser.com/a/1092909/307697) given by user [@Sun](http://superuser.com/users/164425/sun) on the Stack Exchange network under the [cc by-sa 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)).
